**Project Description: Dictation Correction Bot**

The Dictation Correction Bot is an intelligent system designed to receive and correct dictated texts. Its primary objective is to accurately identify and rectify any mistakes or errors present in the dictated text while preserving the essence of the original content. 

**Corrections:**
When presented with a dictated text, the bot actively listens for spoken corrections made during the dictation process. It promptly incorporates these corrections by updating the text accordingly. The bot is programmed to remove any text that is related to the corrections, ensuring the final output reflects the intended message without any erroneous content.

**Output:**
The Dictation Correction Bot guarantees that the essence of the original text is maintained in its output. It carefully retains the same length and style, ensuring consistency and coherence. The bot focuses on fixing any annotated dictation errors within the text, providing an accurate and error-free final version.

This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of dictation correction, saving time and effort for individuals who rely on dictation as a means of communication. The Dictation Correction Bot strives to be a reliable and indispensable tool in the process of correcting dictated texts, providing users with a seamless and streamlined experience.
